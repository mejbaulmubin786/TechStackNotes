     - [ ] Decorator: Adding new behavior to objects dynamically.
   - **Behavioral Patterns**:
     - [ ] Strategy: Encapsulating algorithms within classes to make them interchangeable.
     - [ ] Observer: Establishing a one-to-many dependency where objects are notified of state changes.
     - [ ] Command: Encapsulating a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
     - [ ] State: Allowing an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
     - [ ] Chain of Responsibility: Passing a request along a chain of handlers.
