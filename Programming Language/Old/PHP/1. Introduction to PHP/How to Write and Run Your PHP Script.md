### How to Write and Run Your PHP Script

Writing and running a PHP script is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Create a PHP File:**
   Begin by creating a new file and giving it the `.php` extension. For example, name the file `first_script.php`. The `.php` extension tells the server that this file contains PHP code that should be executed.

2. **Write a Simple PHP Script:**
   Open the newly created file in a text editor such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++. Inside the file, write a basic PHP script like the one shown below:
   ```php
   <?php
   echo "Hello, World!";
   ?>
   ```
   This script will display the text "Hello, World!" when run. The `echo` statement is used to output text or variables to the browser or command line.

3. **Save the File:**
   Once youâ€™ve written the script, save the file in your project folder. The code is now ready to be executed.

This is how you can write and run your very first PHP script, making it a crucial step towards building more complex dynamic web applications.
