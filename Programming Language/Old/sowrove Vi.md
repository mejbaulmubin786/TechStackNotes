I have an experience of 1 year at Laravel Web Development. I am searching remote jobs. Suppose you are the job seeker here. Now I will give you the whole job post and you will give me the following things: 1. LinkedIn intro message to my recruiter which should be opened at a first glance 2. Customised content for CV of this particular remote job 3. Customised content for Cover Letter of this remote job 4. Customised content of the emails to be sent to the recruiter.
